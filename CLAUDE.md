# Brownlow Predictor 2026 — Project Context

## Setup

macOS users need `brew install libomp` before `pip install -r requirements.txt`, or LightGBM's native library fails to load on import.

## Overview

Predicts the top 20 finishers in the 2026 AFL Brownlow Medal count. A
LightGBM ranking model trained on 2012+ historical data, scored weekly
against the current season and published as a static leaderboard —
sibling project to `afl-tipster`, same single-repo + GitHub Actions
cron pattern.

## Files

- `brownlow/` — scraping, joining, modeling, and dashboard logic
- `backfill_data.py` — one-time historical data scrape → `data/training_data.parquet`
- `train_model.py` — trains and backtests the model → `model.txt`
- `weekly_update.py` — GitHub Actions cron entry point; scores the latest
  round and regenerates `index.html`

## Data Sources
